## Introduction

Clerk is a developer-first authentication and user management solution. It provides pre-built React components and hooks for sign-in, sign-up, user profile, and organization management. Clerk is designed to be easy to use and customize, and can be dropped into any React or Next.js application.

This template allows you to get started with Clerk and Next.js (App Router) in a matter of minutes, and demonstrates features of Clerk such as:

- Fully functional auth flow with sign-in, sign-up, and a protected page
- Customized Clerk components with Tailwind CSS
- Hooks for accessing user data and authentication state
- Organizations for multi-tenant applications
